# Symptoms Data Analysis and Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes a symptoms dataset to build predictive models for classifying diseases based on symptoms. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various machine learning model implementations.

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
  - Loading the dataset and handling missing values.
  - Data cleaning to prepare for analysis.
  - Encoding categorical data into numerical format.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizations (histograms, bar charts, heatmaps) to understand data distribution.
  - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between symptoms and diseases.
  - Insights from EDA to inform feature engineering and model selection.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Techniques such as scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

- **Model Building:**
  - **Logistic Regression:**
    - Implementation and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - **Decision Trees:**
    - Implementation, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.
  - **Random Forest:**
    - Implementation, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
    - Implementation, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
  - **Neural Networks:**
    - Code for creating, training, and evaluating a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras (commented out).

- **Model Evaluation and Comparison:**
  - Evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrices.
  - Cross-validation to assess model robustness.
  - Visualizations to compare model performance.

- **Results and Evaluation:**
  - Detailed analysis of model results.
  - Comparison of performance to identify the best model.
  - Discussion on strengths and weaknesses of each model.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Summary of findings and model performance.
  - Discussion on potential improvements and future work.
